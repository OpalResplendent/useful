## STB Libraries
The endlessly useful [stb single-file public domain libraries](https://github.com/nothings/stb) get their own little section.  
Those that we've used the most have so far been:
| Library | Description | Commentary |
|:---|:---:|:---|
| [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h) | Image loading library. | Most things end up using this anyway. |
| [stb_truetype.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_truetype.h) | Truetype font decoding. | Good enough to use as base through a product's lifetime. |
| [stb_sprintf.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_sprintf.h) | Fast implementation of sprintf. | Finding this invaluable lately. |
| [stb_easy_font.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_easy_font.h) | Simple bitmap font rendering. | Useful when working quickly. |

## Applications
| Resource  | Genre |  Description |

| [BlockThe Spot](https://github.com/mrpond/BlockTheSpot) | Crack | Lets her open Spotify links. |
| [OBS](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio) | Streaming | There's a reason this one won. |
